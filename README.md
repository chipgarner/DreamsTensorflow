# DreamsTensorflow
Deep Dream / Styles based code for manipulating images in Tensorflow

Based on https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/deepdream/deepdream.ipynb

You need a pre-trained model, e.g. https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/models/inception5h.zip

Uses Cuda 8.0 and cudnn 6, see the tutorial above. (It currently says cudnn 5.1 but Tensorflow only works with 6.0, as of August 20th 2017.)
